Abstract:
This paper addresses the control of a team of nonholonomic mobile robots navigating in a terrain with obstacles while maintaining a desired formation and changing formations when required, using graph theory. We model the team as a triple, (g, r, H), consisting of a group element g that describes the gross position of the lead robot, a set of shape variables r that describe the relative positions of robots, and a control graph H that describes the behaviors of the robots in the formation. Our framework enables the representation and enumeration of possible control graphs and the coordination of transitions between any two formations

Abstract:
We investigate feedback laws used to control multiple robots moving together in a formation. We propose a method for controlling formations that uses only local sensor-based information, in a leader-follower motion. We use methods of feedback linearization to exponentially stabilize the relative distance and orientation of the follower, and show that the zero dynamics of the system are also (asymptotically) stable. We demonstrate in simulation the use of these algorithms to control six robots moving around an obstacle. These types of control laws can be used to control arbitrarily large numbers of robots moving in very general types of formations

Abstract:
Describes how decentralized control theory can be used to analyze the control of multiple cooperative robotic vehicles. Models of cooperation are discussed and related to the input/output reachability, structural observability, and controllability of the entire system. Whereas decentralized control research in the past has concentrated on using decentralized controllers to partition complex physically interconnected systems, this work uses decentralized methods to connect otherwise independent nontouching robotic vehicles so that they behave in a stable, coordinated fashion. A vector Liapunov method is used to prove stability of two examples: the controlled motion of multiple vehicles along a line and the controlled motion of multiple vehicles in formation. Also presented are three applications of this theory: controlling a formation, guarding a perimeter, and surrounding a facility.

Disturbance Propagation in Vehicle Strings
Abstract ¡ªThis note focuses on disturbance propagation in vehicle
strings.It is known that using only relative spacing information to follow
a constant distance behind the preceding vehicle leads to string instability.
Speci .cally,small disturbances acting on one vehicle can propagate and
have a large effect on another vehicle.We show that this limitation is due
to a complementary sensitivity integral constraint.We also examine how
the disturbance to error gain f r an entire platoon scales with the number
of vehicles.This analysis is done f r the predecessor following strategy as
well as a control structure where each vehicle looks at both neighbors.

Coordination Variables and Consensus
Building in Multiple Vehicle Systems

fweiren,beardg@ee.byu.edu, mclain@byu.edu
Much of the research focus in the cooperative control community has been on
formation control problems [1, 3, 7, 10, 19]. This focus may be due to the fact
that the group control problem can be reduced to well-established single-agent
control problems by employing a leader-follower type control strategy. For
example, single-agent path planning and trajectory generation techniques can
be employed for the leader, and conventional trajectory tracking strategies
can be employed for the followers. Indeed, formation control problems are
much like linear systems theory: we search where the light is the brightest.
It can be argued that formation control problems are the simplest type of
coordination problems and that even if they were to be completely solved,
the solution would be of limited usefulness since the formation concept is
of limited utility. This last comment is supported by the observation that
humans cooperate to perform a wide variety of tasks, yet we rarely maintain
formation with each other.

Control Systems Technology, IEEE Transactions on , Volume: 5 , Issue: 3 , May 1997
Pages:269 - 278
This paper presents the experimental results of the tracking control of a car-trailer system. The proposed scheme involves three steps: 1) generate a path off-line using a path space iterative algorithm; 2) linearize the kinematic model about a trajectory which is constructed using the path; and 3) apply a time-varying linear quadratic regulator to track the trajectory. Experiments presented include parallel parking a car, docking a tractor-trailer vehicle, and parallel parking a double tractor-trailer vehicle

Abstract:
This paper describes the theoretical development and evaluation of the multisensor navigation system for high speed road vehicle. The paper focuses on the design of the nonlinear process model that is able to cope with vehicle slip using multisensor data from the inertial sensors, odometry, and D-GPS. The algorithm was evaluated using a vehicle dynamics simulator built to allow the simulation of a wide variety of driving scenarios. The simulation results show that the scheme is able to significantly reduce the errors in vehicle position and orientation estimates. They also show that the scheme allows slip angle estimation and accelerometer bias estimation

This paper deals with a path planning and intelligent control of an autonomous robot which should move safely in partially structured environment. This environment may involve any number of obstacles of arbitrary shape and size; some of them are allowed to move. We describe our approach to solving the motion-planning problem in mobile robot control using neural networks-based technique. Our method of the construction of a collision-free path for moving robot among obstacles is based on two neural networks. The first neural network is used to determine the "free" space using ultrasound range finder data. The second neural network "finds" a safe direction for the next robot section of the path in the workspace while avoiding the nearest obstacles. Simulation examples of generated path with proposed techniques will be presented.

Abstract:
Presents an experimental identification of dynamic parameters of a non-direct drive robot and its load, which appear in the integral model, based on the energy theorem formulation. In the robotics literature, there are no experimental results known to the authors concerning the identification of the integral model parameters. In order to satisfy this, an experimental set-up has been built around an industrial ASEA IRp-6 robot. Next the robot dynamic integral model, taking into account friction parameters (viscous and Coulomb), as well as the load dynamic model have been formulated. The experimental results have been presented, including comparison of the results for both integral and differential identification

A nonlinear spatial path tracking control law, called
the 2-controller (C2), was developed for autonomous
ground vehicles (AGVs) such as the USU T-series and
ODIS (omni-directional inspection system) wheeled
mobile robots (WMRs). It is essentially a SISO regulator
operating on the normal spatial deviation, 2,
of the robot from the desired path. As our performance
expectation of C2 is entirely spatial a logical
choice of the regulator should avoid any reference to
time. We present in this paper a spatial integrator PI
(SI-PI) regulator for C2 which is devoid of any time
references while its structure includes some of the robot
dynamics. It is also shown that the control action
taken by this regulator represents the work done in
moving the robot through an error vector field. The
regulator gains are designed using a validated nonlinear
SimulinkTM/StateFlow model. The experimental
results presented show the effectiveness of the proposed
SI-PI regulation scheme in the path tracking control of
the ODIS WMR.

Fast and Easy Systematic and Stochastic Odometry Calibration
Alonzo Kelly
Abstract - A method of odometry calibration is proposed and
validated which is designed to be as convenient as possible.
Convenience is enhanced by reducing both the amount of software
to be written and the amount of measurements to be
made to a minimum. The path dependent nature of odometry
can be exploited to reduce the amount of ground truth information
to as little as a single known point. Existing odometry
and covariance estimation functions themselves will be used to
extract first order parameter variation. Linearization will be
performed about the approximate available trajectory rather
than the unknown ground truth one. While multiple trajectories
will be required to calibrate variance models, it will not be
required that they be the same or even similar. The technique
is general enough to apply to any form of odometry and it is
general enough to be used for the extraction of unknown
parameters of either systematic odometry models or stochastic
error models. The derivation and experimental validation of
the technique are presented.

Feedback Control of a Two Wheeled Mobile
Robot with Obstacle Avoidance
Using Potential Functions
Takateru Urakubo, Kenji Okuma, Yukio Tada
Abstract¡ªThis paper deals with the feedback stabilization
problem for a two wheeled mobile robot which moves in the
presence of obstacles. A state feedback controller is proposed
based on Lyapunov control. First, we choose a potential
function (Lyapunov function) whose value is minimum at a
desired point and maximum on the surfaces of obstacles. And
then, we construct a control input by multiplying the gradient
vector of the potential function by a matrix composed of a
negative definite symmetric one and a skew-symmetric one. It
is shown that the system with the controller converges to one
of critical points of the potential function. When the potential
function has some critical points other than the minimum
at the desired point, in order to avoid convergence to those
points, the controller is modified. As a result, the controlled
system converges to the desired point avoiding collision with
obstacles.

The beam analysis algorithm for path planning
for redundant manipulators
Erdinc Sahin Conkur a,*, Rob Buckingham b,
Andrew Harrison
Abstract
An algorithm for path planning for redundant manipulators is presented in this paper. The
algorithm uses harmonic potential fields defined globally in W-space (work space) for both
path planning and obstacle avoidance. Although paths generated by harmonic potential fields
are collision free for point robots, this is not always the case for manipulators when especially
tight manoeuvring is required. To enhance collision avoidance ability of redundant manipulators,
the beam analysis algorithm is proposed. The algorithm sends beams along the path generated
for point robots to determine virtual obstacle points where collision with obstacle is
likely to occur. The potential field is then regenerated to include these virtual obstacle points.
Besides, the interaction between manipulator links and the potential field is accomplished by
the control points situated on only proximal ends of the links. The virtual obstacle points and
selected control points allow the manipulator to achieve tight manoeuvring in W-spaces cluttered
with many obstacles. The improvement in performance is also clearly indicated by a
benchmark scheme that compares the algorithms by means of the complexity of the environment
with respect to link lengths of redundant manipulators. Furthermore, the beam analysis
algorithm readily produces safer paths for mobile robots, which does not suffer too far or too
close problems. Examples are included to demonstrate these features of the algorithm.

Sensor scheduling in continuous time
H.W.J. Lee, K.L. Teo, Andrew E.B. Lim

Abstract
Let N be the number of available sensor sources. Noisy observations of an underlying state process are available for these
Nsources. We consider the continuous time sensor scheduling problem in which N
of these Nsources are to be chosen to collect data
at each time point. This sensor scheduling problem (with switching costs and switching constraints) is formulated as a constrained
optimal control problem. In this framework, the controls represent the sensors that are chosen at a particular time. Thus, the control
variables are constrained to take values in a discrete set, and switchings between sensors can occur in continuous time. By
incorporating recent results on discrete valued optimal control, we show that this problem can be transformed into an equivalent
continuous optimal control problem. In this way, we obtain the sensor scheduling policy as well as the associated switching
times.

Model-Based Solution Techniques for the Source Localization Problem
Mehmet E. Alpay and Molly H. Shor, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract¡ªThe problem of locating sources in dynamical
systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) is a
particular case of the more general class of inverse problems.
Source localization problems are often approached using nonmodel-
based techniques. By using a priori knowledge of system
dynamics, model-based approaches to this problem can be developed,
reducing the number of sensors required to solve the
problem. This paper presents three such approaches: off-line
numerical computation of the time response data at the sensor(s)
from all possible source locations and functions of source strength,
spatial and time discretization of the PDE model, and off-line
solution of a dual (¡°forward¡±) PDE problem based on the adjoint
system model. In each case, a particular algorithm is presented,
and analysis of appropriate sensor placement and the minimal
number of sensors required is given. In all three approaches, a
minimal amount of on-line processing is required. The relative
strengths and shortcomings of the three approaches are discussed
and are demonstrated through application to the two-dimensional
isotropic heat equation.

Abstract:
This paper examines the problem of cooperative localization for the case
of large groups of mobile robots. A Kalman filter estimator is
implemented and tested for this purpose. The focus of this paper is to
examine the effect on localization accuracy of the number N of
participating robots and the accuracy of the sensors employed. More
specifically, we investigate the improvement in localization accuracy
per additional robot as the size of the team increases. Furthermore, we
provide an analytical expression for the upper bound on the positioning
uncertainty increase rate for a team of N robots as a function of N, the
odometric and orientation uncertainty for the robots, and the accuracy
of a robot tracker measuring relative positions between pairs of robots.
The analytical results derived in this paper are validated both in
simulation and experimentally for different test cases.

Keywords: multirobot localization; cooperative localization; distributed
sensing; networks of robots

Abstract:
This paper presents a new estimation method, entitled the asynchronous sampling pulse method (ASPM), for determining velocity in systems with low but variable speeds, and/or with low-resolution encoders. The ASPM forces the estimator procedure to synchronize with the actual encoder pulse input, thus eliminating encoder positioning error independent of target velocity variations. This method is based on using an auxiliary sampling period to measure the time interval between the moment of encoder input and the control sampling instant, and its precision is shown to be dependent only on this auxiliary sampling period. Thus, the ASPM improves over existing methods in which estimator performance is dependent on both target acceleration and encoder resolution. Simulation and experimental results are used to verify the method.

LINEAR QUADRATIC GAUSSIAN BALANCING FOR
DISCRETE-TIME INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL LINEAR SYSTEMS .
MARK R.OPMEER .AND RUTH F.CURTAIN .
Abstract.In this paper,we study the existence of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG)¨Cbalanced
realizations for discrete-time in .nite-dimensional systems.LQG-balanced realizations are those for
which the smallest nonnegative self-adjoint solutions of the control and .lter Riccati equations are
equal.We show that the control (.lter)Riccati equation has a nonnegative self-adjoint solution if
and only if the system is output (input)stabilizable.Our main result is that the transfer function
of a discrete-time linear system has an approximately controllable and observable LQG-balanced
realization i .it has an input and output stabilizable realization.The corresponding control and
.lter Riccati equations have unique nonnegative self-adjoint solutions.Moreover,approximately
controllable and observable LQG-balanced realizations are unique up to a unitary state-space trans-
formation.Finally,we show that the spectrum of the product of the smallest nonnegative self-adjoint
solutions of the control and .lter Riccati equations is independent of the particular realization.

ON-LINE PARAMETER ESTIMATION
FOR INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
J. BAUMEISTERy, W. SCONDOz, M. A. DEMETRIOUx, AND I. G. ROSEN{
Abstract. The on-line or adaptive identication of parameters in abstract linear and nonlin-
ear innite-dimensional dynamical systems is considered. An estimator in the form of an innite-
dimensional linear evolution system having the state and parameter estimates as its states is dened.
Convergence of the state estimator is established via a Lyapunov estimate. The nite-dimensional
notion of a plant being suciently rich or persistently excited is extended to innite dimensions. Con-
vergence of the parameter estimates is established under the additional assumption that the plant
is persistently excited. A nite-dimensional approximation theory is developed, and convergence
results are established. Numerical results for examples involving the estimation of both constant and
functional parameters in one-dimensional linear and nonlinear heat or diusion equations and the es-
timation of stiness and damping parameters in a one-dimensional wave equation with Kelvin{Voigt
viscoelastic damping are presented.

OPTIMIZABILITY AND ESTIMATABILITY FOR

GEORGE WEISS .AND RICHARD REBARBER .
Abstract.An in .nite-dimensional linear system described by ¨Bx (t )=Ax (t )+Bu (t )(t ¡Ý0)is
said to be optimizable if for every initial state x (0),an input u ¡ÊL 2 can be found such that x ¡ÊL 2 .
Here,A is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup on a Hilbert space and B is an admissible
control operator for this semigroup.In this paper we investigate optimizability (also known as the
.nite cost condition)and its dual,estimatability.We explore the connections with stabilizability and
detectability.We give a very general theorem about the equivalence of input-output stability and
exponential stability of well-posed linear systems:the two are equivalent if the system is optimizable
and estimatable.We conclude that a well-posed system is exponentially stable if and only if it is
dynamically stabilizable and input-output stable.We illustrate the theory by two examples based
on PDEs in two or more space dimensions:the wave equation and a structural acoustics model.

Localized Edge Detection in Sensor Fields
Krishna Kant Chintalapudi, Ramesh Govindan
University of Southern California, Los Angeles,
California, USA, 90007.
Abstract
A wireless sensor network for detecting large-scale phenom-ena
(such as a contaminant flow or a seismic disturbance) may
be called upon to provide a description of the boundary of the
phenomenon (either a contour or some bounding box). In such
cases, it may be necessary for each node to locally determine
whether it lies at (or near) the edge of the phenomenon. In
this paper, we show that such localized edge detection tech-niques
are non-trivial to design in an arbitrarily deployed sen-sor
network. We define the notion of an edge and develop
performance metrics for evaluating localized edge detection
algorithms. We propose three different approaches for local-ized
edge detection and present one example scheme for each.
In all our approaches, each sensor gathers information from its
local neighborhood and determines whether or not it is an edge
sensor. We evaluate the performance of each of the example
schemes and compare them with respect to the developed met-rics.

Abstract:
The measurement of steady-state and transient load-angle, angular velocity, and acceleration using an optical encoder is described. The accuracy of measurement is assessed, and results are given for the run-up of a three-phase reluctance motor. Accurate values of speed and load-angle are determined, but the measurement of acceleration is more difficult, and significant errors are present for values in excess of approximately 50 mechanical rad/s2. Predicted results for a computer model are in reasonable agreement

Shaft encoder characterisation through analysis of the mean-squared errors in nonideal quantised systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Incremental shaft encoders with square outputs are characterised by quantisation of the sensed position and by additional errors caused by nonidealities in sensor construction that contribute to additional measurement error. Digital estimates of the velocity of a rotating mass are frequently calculated by the differentiation of successive quantised position estimates, derived from a digital sensor such as a shaft encoder. New formulae are presented for the associated mean-squared error. In particular, the combined influences of uniformly distributed noise, sinusoidal perturbations and quantisation error on a nominally constant rate system are treated in an analytical manner. Experimental data, obtained from encoder-based shaft velocity measurements, are utilised for sensor characterisation, using the theoretical models proposed. A 'figure-of-merit', defining the differential error caused by variations of transition locations from their nominal values over the circumference o!
f the encoder, is obtained. It is shown that the influence of shaft velocity variation on the characterization process can be minimised by deriving the variation in the mean-squared velocity error due to the addition of a sinusoidal perturbation

Reconfigurable Robot Teams: Modeling and Supervisory Control
Diana Gordon-Spears and Kiriakos Kiriakidis
Abstract¡ªTeams of land-based, airborne, or submerged robots
constitute a new breed of robotic systems for which the issue of
controlled behavior arises naturally. In this brief, we model the
dynamics of the robot team in the discrete-event system (DES)
framework and design a reconfigurable system that can handle
situations in which robot units may switch offline. In particular,
we exploit the dichotomy between controllable and uncontrollable
behavior to synthesize a supervisor using only controllable events,
but also one whose structure adapts to uncontrollable events. This
brief presents a novel method based on learning and verification for
restoring supervision as well as behavioral assurance of the team.

A Hybrid-Control Approach to the Parking Problem of a Wheeled Vehicle Using Limited View-Angle Visual Feedback
http://ijr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/4-5/437?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=odometry+&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1103763642021_382&stored_search=&FIRSTINDEX=20&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=1&journalcode=spijr
In this paper we consider the mobile robot parking problem, i.e., the stabilization of a wheeled vehicle to a given position and orientation, using only visual feedback from low-cost cameras. We take into account the practically most relevant problem of keeping the tracked features in sight of the camera while maneuvering to park the vehicle. This constraint, often neglected in the literature, combines with the non-holonomic nature of the vehicle kinematics in a challenging controller design problem. We provide an effective solution to such a problem by using a combination of previous results on non-smooth control synthesis and recently developed hybrid control techniques. Simulations and experimental results on a laboratory vehicle are reported, showing the practicality of the proposed approach.

Abstract:
A repetitive process is a 2D system characterised uniquely by a series of sweeps, termed passes, through a set of dynamics defined over a finite and fixed duration-termed the pass length and denoted by ¦Á. On each pass an output, termed the pass profile and denoted by Yk(t),0&les;t&les;¦Á, acts as a forcing function on, and hence contributes to, the new pass profile Yk+1(t), 0&les;t&les;¦Á, k&les;0. The unique control problem is that the output sequence {Yk}k&ges;1, generated in response to an initial profile Y0 and a sequence of current pass inputs/disturbances, can contain oscillations which increase in amplitude from pass to pass. Smyth (1992) describes in detail how this behaviour can arise in physically based examples, both in simulation and experiments on scaled models of industrial examples. The present authors describe the development of a rigorous stability theory, applicable to all linear dynamics constant pass length examples, which removes difficulties encountered in trying to apply directly standard linear theory and tests. The elements of this theory are summarised

Abstract:
We introduce a new learning control method, direct learning control, which is defined as the generation of the desired control input profile directly from existing control input profiles without any repeated learning. The motivation of developing direct learning control schemes is to overcome the limitation of conventional learning control methods which require that the desired tracking patterns (trajectories) be strictly identical (repeatable) throughout the learning process. There are two main advantages of the direct learning control method. The first is that the learning control system is capable of fully utilizing the prestored control input signals which may correspond to tracking patterns with different time scales and be achieved through various control approaches. The second is the direct generation of the desired control input profile; thereafter it is possible to remove the whole iterative learning process. The focus of this paper is on direct learning of a class of nonperiodic trajectories which are identical in spatial distribution but different in time scales

A system for learning the pre-grasp positioning task for a robot manipulator is presented. The images delivered from a gripper mounted camera are analysed using Gabor filters which resemble the spatial response profiles of receptive fields found in visual cortex neurons. Using a quite small feature set, the system demonstrated efficiency with respect to speed and accuracy, as well as robustness against changing light conditions. Furthermore, we compare it to two other approaches, aiming at the same goal: an appearance-based PCA fuzzy control and a PSOM based Hough-Transform system

Abstract:
In this paper PI and PID controllers augmented by a Smith predictor structure are compared to ordinary PI and PID controllers, for plants with medium and great time delays. The comparison is based an a systematic evaluation method, where both robustness and performance aspects in different frequency regions are taken into account. The results show that a Smith predictor increases performance somewhat for a PID controller when the time delay is moderate. For great time delays, however, the improvement is insignificant. An important remark is that it is necessary to include the predictor structure in the design to get acceptable robustness properties. For a PI controller the benefits from a predictor are mostly small or negligible independent of time delay. Most important is, however that a derivative part obviously will bring significantly greater improvement than a Smith predictor to a system with a PI controller. This result is somewhat surprising, since Smith predictors are normally used together with PI and not with PID controllers. Furthermore, it is sometimes argued that it is no use to include derivative action for plants with significant time delay

Abstract:
In this paper a new control scheme for uncertain time-delay systems is put forward, in which the precise model of the plant is not necessary. The time delay term is taken outside the characteristic equation of the closed-loop transfer function. Any variation of time delay does not influence the system's dynamic performance and the steady state. And the change of the process parameters does not influence the stability of the system. The parameters of the controller, adopted as PI controller, do not need adjustment frequently so that it is easy to control the system in practice. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme is superior to the Smith predictor in the presence of large uncertainty in process dynamics.

Abstract:
This paper is to provide a guide to the time-delay compensation scheme known as Smith predictor control which uses feedback loop for controlling any system. The Smith predictor control was devised to remove the delay effect from the closed-loop design, and is equivalent to IMC in the sense that the delayed behavior of the plant is cancelled by the plant model. The internal model control (IMC) scheme is discussed together to understand the Smith predictor control in terms of newer theoretical concepts. Related topics such as disturbance rejection, /spl Hscr//sub 2/ optimality, stability, robustness, MIMO systems, SISO systems and windup problem are also discussed.

Abstract:
A simple relay feedback automatic tuning method is proposed for the modified Smith predictor, to provide a controller for stable, unstable and integrating processes with long dead time. A single asymmetrical relay feedback test is used to obtain a reduced order process model in terms of a second order dynamics plus dead time model. Very simple but straightforward tuning formulae are derived for the controllers which have a simple relationship with the plant model parameters. Thus the plant model blocks in the Smith predictor structure, as well as all the controllers are designed from a single asymmetrical relay test. Excellent performance of the auto-tuned Smith predictor has been substantiated by simulations

Abstract:
A model of an incremental shaft encoder is developed to facilitate sensor characterization. The model is obtained through derivation of a new mathematical formula for the spectral characteristics of the error which accrues when a sampled, nominally constant-rate signal is uniformly quantized, having been subject to both differential and integral nonlinearities. The spectrum of the error in the rate estimate generated when a digital differentiator is applied to such a signal is shown to be of particular importance. Subsequent sensor characterization involves some basic signal processing of a set of sampled sensor outputs, obtained when the encoder rotates at an almost uniform rate, followed by a simple curve-fitting procedure using the formula for estimated rate error. Both computer-generated, finite-length data sets and experimental data derived from encoder-based shaft velocity measurements are utilized to verify the theoretical model. The methodology of the mathematical analysis is applicable to other digital sensors and to a more general class of systems; such as data converters, which involve the digital differentiation of quantized, noise-affected signals. The paper illustrates how the combined influence of quantization error and of additional sources of noise can be described in an analytical, but applicable, manner

Abstract:
The measurement of steady-state and transient load-angle, angular velocity, and acceleration using an optical encoder is described. The accuracy of measurement is assessed, and results are given for the run-up of a three-phase reluctance motor. Accurate values of speed and load-angle are determined, but the measurement of acceleration is more difficult, and significant errors are present for values in excess of approximately 50 mechanical rad/s2. Predicted results for a computer model are in reasonable agreement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Incremental shaft encoders with square outputs are characterised by quantisation of the sensed position and by additional errors caused by nonidealities in sensor construction that contribute to additional measurement error. Digital estimates of the velocity of a rotating mass are frequently calculated by the differentiation of successive quantised position estimates, derived from a digital sensor such as a shaft encoder. New formulae are presented for the associated mean-squared error. In particular, the combined influences of uniformly distributed noise, sinusoidal perturbations and quantisation error on a nominally constant rate system are treated in an analytical manner. Experimental data, obtained from encoder-based shaft velocity measurements, are utilised for sensor characterisation, using the theoretical models proposed. A 'figure-of-merit', defining the differential error caused by variations of transition locations from their nominal values over the circumference of the encoder, is obtained. It is shown that the influence of shaft velocity variation on the characterization process can be minimised by deriving the variation in the mean-squared velocity error due to the addition of a sinusoidal perturbation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
This paper presents a new estimation method, entitled the asynchronous sampling pulse method (ASPM), for determining velocity in systems with low but variable speeds, and/or with low-resolution encoders. The ASPM forces the estimator procedure to synchronize with the actual encoder pulse input, thus eliminating encoder positioning error independent of target velocity variations. This method is based on using an auxiliary sampling period to measure the time interval between the moment of encoder input and the control sampling instant, and its precision is shown to be dependent only on this auxiliary sampling period. Thus, the ASPM improves over existing methods in which estimator performance is dependent on both target acceleration and encoder resolution. Simulation and experimental results are used to verify the method.

Sensor Based Robot Localisation and Navigation: Using Interval Analysis and Unscented Kalman
Abstract¡ªMultiple sensor fusion for robot localisation and
navigation has attracted a lot of interest in recent years.
This paper describes a sensor based navigation approach
using an interval analysis (IA) based adaptive mechanism for
an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The robot is equipped
with inertial sensors (INS), encoders and ultrasonic sensors.
An UKF is used to estimate the robots position using the
inertial sensors and encoders. Since the UKF estimates may be
affected by bias, drift etc. we propose an adaptive mechanism
using IA to correct these defects in estimates. In the presence
of land marks the complementary robot position information
from the IA algorithm using ultrasonic sensors is used to
estimate and bound the errors in the UKF robot position
estimate.

mynote: interesting. IA may be good for Sonar localization.

Abstract:
Vehicle control systems such as collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, and automated lane-keeping systems as well as ABS and stability control systems can benefit significantly from being made "road-adaptive." The estimation of tire-road friction coefficient at the wheels allows the control algorithm in such systems to adapt to external driving conditions. This paper develops a new tire-road friction coefficient estimation algorithm based on measurements related to the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. A lateral tire force model parameterized as a function of slip angle, friction coefficient, normal force and cornering stiffness is used. A real-time parameter identification algorithm that utilizes measurements from a differential global positioning system (DGPS) system and a gyroscope is used to identify the tire-road friction coefficient and cornering stiffness parameters of the tire. The advantage of the developed algorithm is that it does not require large longitudinal slip in order to provide reliable friction estimates. Simulation studies indicate that a parameter convergence rate of 1 s can be obtained. Experiments conducted on both dry and slippery road indicate that the algorithm can work very effectively in identifying a slippery road

Abstract:
An on-road analytical tire model has been developed to predict tire forces and moments at the tire/road interface. The model is computationally efficient and it only requires a limited set of easily obtained input parameters. Force and moment calculations are based on mechanical analogs that describe longitudinal and lateral tire tread and sidewall deflections during braking, traction and cornering. Longitudinal deflections are determined using a simple linear elastic spring model, while lateral deflections are calculated using an elastic beam model. Surface sliding friction is defined by experimental curves relating the friction coefficient to the wheel/road differential velocity. Source code has been developed to include the model as a force element subroutine in commercially available dynamic analysis software known as DADS (Dynamic Analysis Design System). The tire model has been successfully demonstrated in DADS using a simple simulation of a tire test device. Preliminary comparisons of model predictions with available test data have been favorable. Efforts are underway to incorporate the tire subroutine into a DADS model of a HMMWV to conduct driving simulations on dry, snow and ice covered road surfaces

Self-localization of Mobile Robots with RFID
System by using Support Vector Machine
Kentaro Yamano, Kanji Tanaka, Mitsuru Hirayama, Eiji Kondo, Yoshihiko Kimuro, Michito Matsumoto
Abstract¡ªIn recent years, RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification)
System has become very popular in service industries,
logistics and manufacturing, as it is an inexpensive and
reliable device for automatic identification. Therefore, RFID
system would be useful in a problem of mobile robot selflocalization,
if tags are distributed in the environment, and
if the robot is equipped with a RFID reader to communicate
with the tags. In this paper, we propose a novel method
for learning-based localization with a RFID System by using
Support Vector Machine (SVM). In order to obtain various
training data for SVM learning, a number of synthesized
sensor data are generated from limited amount of real sensor
data. We also propose a method that enables a user to
easily place tags in effective locations. In experiments with a
mobile robot, the performance of the proposed method will
be demonstrated.

Robust Distributed Network Localization
with Noisy Range Measurements
David Moore John Leonard Daniela Rus Seth Teller
ABSTRACT
This paper describes a distributed, linear-time algorithm for
localizing sensor network nodes in the presence of range measurement
noise and demonstrates the algorithm on a physical
network. We introduce the probabilistic notion of robust
quadrilaterals as a way to avoid
ip ambiguities that otherwise
corrupt localization computations. We formulate the
localization problem as a two-dimensional graph realization
problem: given a planar graph with approximately known
edge lengths, recover the Euclidean position of each vertex
up to a global rotation and translation. This formulation
is applicable to the localization of sensor networks in which
each node can estimate the distance to each of its neighbors,
but no absolute position reference such as GPS or xed anchor
nodes is available.
We implemented the algorithm on a physical sensor network
and empirically assessed its accuracy and performance.
Also, in simulation, we demonstrate that the algorithm scales
to large networks and handles real-world deployment geometries.
Finally, we show how the algorithm supports localization
of mobile nodes

Adaptive Mobile Robot Navigation and Mapping
Hans Jacob S. Feder
The task of building a map of an unknown environment and concurrently using that map to navigate is a central problem in mobile robotics research. This paper addresses the problem of how to perform concurrent mapping and localization (CML) adaptively using sonar. Stochastic mapping is a feature-based approach to CML that generalizes the extended Kalman filter to incorporate vehicle localization and environmental mapping. The authors describe an implementation of stochastic mapping that uses a delayed nearest neighbor data association strategy to initialize new features into the map, match measurements to map features, and delete out-of-date features. The authors introduce a metric for adaptive sensing that is defined in terms of Fisher information and represents the sum of the areas of the error ellipses of the vehicle and feature estimates in the map. Predicted sensor readings and expected dead-reckoning errors are used to estimate the metric for each potential action of the robot, and the action that yields the lowest cost (i.e., the maximum information) is selected. This technique is demonstrated via simulations, in-air sonar experiments, and underwater sonar experiments. Results are shown for (1) adaptive control of motion and (2) adaptive control of motion and scanning. The vehicle tends to explore selectively different objects in the environment. The performance of this adaptive algorithm is shown to be superior to straight-line motion and random motion.

Abstract:
This paper presents a real-time algorithm for acquiring compact three-dimensional maps of indoor environments, using a mobile robot equipped with range and imaging sensors. Building on previous work on real-time pose estimation during mapping, our approach extends the popular expectation-maximization algorithm to multisurface models, and makes it amenable to real-time execution. Maps acquired by our algorithm consist of compact sets of textured polygons that can be visualized interactively. Experimental results obtained in corridor-type environments illustrate that compact and accurate maps can be acquired in real time and in a fully automated fashion.

A Dual-Space Approach to Tracking and Sensor
Management in Wireless Sensor Networks
Abstract 1 ¡ª Wireless ad hoc sensor networks have the
advantage of spanning a large geographical region and being
able to collaboratively detect and track non-local spatio-temporal
events. This paper presents a dual-space approach
to event tracking and sensor resource management in sensor
networks. An implemented application of detecting and
tracking light shadow edges moving over a sensor field is
described. The dual-space transformation maps a non-local
phenomenon, e.g., the edge of a half-plane shadow, to a
single point in the dual space, and maps locations of
distributed sensor nodes to a set of lines that partitions the
dual space. The detection problem becomes finding and
tracking the cell that contains the point in the arrangement
defined by these lines. This mechanism can be effectively
used for power management of the sensor network ¨C nodes
that will not be immediately visited by the shadow can be
turned off to save energy. The approach has been
successfully demonstrated on a laboratory testbed built
using the UC Berkeley sensor motes.

Boundary Estimation in Sensor Networks: Theory and Methods
Sensor networks have emerged as a fundamentally new tool for moni-
toring spatially distributed phenomena. This paper investigates a strategy
by which sensor nodes detect and estimate non-localized phenomena such
as \boundaries" and \edges" (e.g., temperature gradients, variations in
illumination or contamination levels). A general class of boundaries, with
mild regularity assumptions, is considered, and theoretical bounds on the
achievable performance of sensor network based boundary estimation are
established. A hierarchical boundary estimation algorithm is proposed
that achieves a near-optimal balance between mean-squared error and en-
ergy consumption.

Abstract:
Mobile robots need sufficient sensors and information on the environment in order to navigate. In this paper, we propose a system of mobile robots, which is controlled in a distributed intelligent sensor network. In such a networked space, the environment is divided by distributed sensors. Each area is monitored by a distributed sensor device, which connects with other distributed sensor devices and robots throughout the network. As a result, the mobile robots are able to accomplish tasks simply by following orders from the sensor devices in the networked environment, although the mobile robots are not self-contained with information on the environment and sensors for self-positioning and control. We test several situations to verify the proposed system.

Sensor networks are gaining a central role in the research community. This paper addresses some of the issues arising from the use of sensor networks in control applications. Classical control theory proves to be insufficient in modeling distributed control problems where issues of communication delay, jitter, and time synchronization between components are not negligible. After discussing our hardware and software platform and our target application, we review useful models of computation and then suggest a mixed model for design, analysis, and synthesis of control algorithms within sensor networks. We present a hierarchical model composed of continuous time-trigger components at the low level and discrete event-triggered components at the high level.

Abstract:
Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this article we present a survey of state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first outline the design challenges for routing protocols in WSNs followed by a comprehensive survey of routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into three categories based on the underlying network structure: flit, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Furthermore, these protocols can be classified into multipath-based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based, and coherent-based depending on the protocol operation. We study the design trade-offs between energy and communication overhead savings in every routing paradigm. We also highlight the advantages and performance issues of each routing technique. The article concludes with possible future research areas.

On page(s): 94- 98

Abstract:
The problem of sensor placement for optimal filtering and smoothing problems is considered. Matrix equations are derived that relate individual changes in sensor locations to changes in the covariance matrix. These gradient matrices are used in formulating a design procedure that seeks the optimal sensor location for a particular estimation problem. The derivation and use of these gradient matrices are the main contributions of this paper. This approach avoids using indirect measures of performance offered through observability and information matrix. A numerical example demonstrates that an optimal sensor location for a filtering problem is not necessarily optimal for a smoothing problem. The particular sensor placement to be chosen will depend then on the type of problem at hand.

Abstract:
An active sensing method for multisensor fusion systems with actuators is proposed. To realize active sensing with multiple sensors: (i) where to position sensors; (ii) how to associate data; and (iii) how to fuse data should be determined. The authors propose a new method mainly concerning (i). The method utilizes estimated errors of estimates to determine optimal sensor locations where useful data are expected to be obtained and effectively associated. As examples, the active sensing method is applied to multitarget tracking by a system with two hand-eye cameras, and visual and tactile fusion in a system with a camera and a tactile sensor. By using this method, the sensing strategy is optimized for the object of measurement

We present a computationally very efficient learning control method which is ideally tailored to high-precision velocity control of servo motors in the presence of the disturbance torque which is unknown, unstructured, and state-dependent. The proposed learning control method can drive the steady state velocity error to zero and, furthermore, can be used to identify the unknown disturbance torque in look-up table form. In order to demonstrate the generality and practical use of our work, we present the rigorous convergence analysis of the learning control algorithm and some experimental results using a single degree-of-freedom manipulator

Abstract:
A new finite-dimensional repetitive controller of plug-in type is proposed for high precision velocity control of servomechanisms subject to significant nonlinear disturbance torque. The disturbance torque dealt with depends on system states, i.e. velocity and position, and is assumed to be continuously periodic in position and locally Lipschitzian in velocity, which can address most cases in practice. A sufficient condition for the effectiveness of the proposed method is derived by the application of fix point theorem. It should be noted that this condition is necessary for learning the algorithms utilizing the period-invariance property of the system. With the proposed finite-dimensional repetitive controller, the steady-state velocity error can be reduced to a very low degree. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation results.

Abstract:
Intelligent mechatronics makes it possible to compensate for effects that are difficult to compensate for by construction or by linear control, by including some intelligence into the system. The compensation of state dependent effects, e.g. friction, cogging and mass deviation, can be realised by learning feedforward control. This method identifies these disturbing effects as function of their states and compensates for these, before they introduce an error. Because the effects are learnt as function of their states, this method can be used for non-repetitive motions. The learning of state dependent effects relies on the update signal that is used. In previous work, the feedback control signal was used as an error measure between the approximation and the true state dependent effect. If the effects introduce a signal that contains frequencies near the bandwidth, the phase shift between this signal and the feedback signal might seriously degenerate the performance of the approximation. The use of phase correction overcomes this problem. This is validated by a set of simulations and experiments that show the necessity of the phase corrected scheme.

STATE-PERIODIC ADAPTIVE FRICTION
COMPENSATION
Hyo-Sung Ahn and YangQuan Chen
Abstract: This paper focuses on the adaptive friction compensation, where the
friction is considered as a position-dependent disturbance. We consider the case
when the desired trajectory is state (e.g., position) periodical which is of course
also time periodical. The key idea of our approach is to use one trajectory past
information along the state axis to update the current adaptation since the friction
is state-periodic. The new method consists of two main steps: Firstly, in the first
repetitive trajectory, an adaptive compensator is designed to guarantee the `2-
stability of the overall system; and secondly, from the second repetitive trajectory
and onwards, a state-periodic adaptive compensator is designed based on stored
past state-dependent information. Rigorous stability analysis is presented with a
simulation example.

Kalman Filtering with Partial Observation Losses
Xiangheng Liu and Andrea Goldsmith

Abstract¡ªWe study the Kalman filtering problem when
part or all of the observation measurements are lost in a
random fashion. We formulate the Kalman filtering problem
with partial observation losses and derive the Kalman filter
updates with partial observation measurements. We show that
with these partial measurements the Kalman filter and its
error covariance matrix iteration become stochastic, since they
now depend on the random packet arrivals of the sensor
measurements, which can be lost or delayed when transmitted
over a communication network. The communication network
needs to provide a sufficient throughput for each of the
sensor measurements in order to guarantee the stability of
the Kalman filter, where the throughput captures the rate of
the sensor measurements correctly received. We investigate
the statistical convergence properties of the error covariance
matrix iteration as a function of the throughput of the
sensor measurements. A throughput region that guarantees
the convergence of the error covariance matrix is found by
solving a feasibility problem of a linear matrix inequality.
We also find an unstable throughput region such that the
state estimation error of the Kalman filter is unbounded. The
expected error covariance matrix is bounded both from above
and from below. The results are illustrated with some simple
numerical examples.

Kalman Filtering with Intermittent
Observations
http://www.paradise.caltech.edu/~massimo/homepage/papers/kalman.pdf

Motivated by navigation and tracking applications within sensor networks, we consider the problem
of performing Kalman ltering with intermittent observations. When data travel along unreliable
communication channels in a large, wireless, multi-hop sensor network, the effect of communication
delays and loss of information in the control loop cannot be neglected. We address this problem starting
from the discrete Kalman ltering formulation, and modelling the arrival of the observation as a random
process. We study the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, showing the
existence of a critical value for the arrival rate of the observations, beyond which a transition to an
unbounded state error covariance occurs. We also give upper and lower bounds on this expected state
error covariance.

Kalman Filtering with Partial Observation Losses
Xiangheng Liu and Andrea Goldsmith

We study the Kalman filtering problem when part or all of the observation measurements are lost in a random
fashion. Pioneering work has recently addressed the Kalman filtering problem with intermittent observations, where
the observation measurements are either received in full or completely lost. Partial observation losses can occur
in a distributed control system where measurements are taken at different sensors that are at different physical
locations or one sensor needs to send its data in multiple packets. We formulate the Kalman filtering problem with
partial observation losses and derive the Kalman filter updates with partial observation measurements. We show that
with these partial measurements the Kalman filter and its error covariance matrix iteration become stochastic, since
they now depend on the random packet arrivals of the sensor measurements, which can be lost or delayed when
transmitted over a communication network. The communication network needs to provide a sufficient throughput
for each of the sensor measurements in order to guarantee the stability of the Kalman filter, where the throughput
captures the rate of the sensor measurements correctly received. We investigate the statistical convergence properties
of the error covariance matrix iteration as a function of the throughput of the sensor measurements. A throughput
region that guarantees the convergence of the error covariance matrix is found by solving a feasibility problem of a
Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). We also find an unstable throughput region such that the state estimation error of
the Kalman filter is unbounded. When the Kalman filter is stable, the expected error covariance matrix is bounded
both from above and from below. The results are illustrated with some simple numerical examples.

Synopsis Diffusion for Robust Aggregation in Sensor Networks
Suman Nathy; Phillip B. Gibbons Srinivasan Seshany Zachary R. Anderson
Previous approaches for computing duplicate-sensitive ag-
gregates in sensor networks (e.g., in TAG) have used a
tree topology, in order to conserve energy and to avoid
double-counting sensor readings. However, a tree topol-
ogy is not robust against node and communication fail-
ures, which are common in sensor networks. In this pa-
per, we present synopsis diusion, a general framework for
achieving signicantly more accurate and reliable answers
by combining energy-ecient multi-path routing schemes
with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis dif-
fusion avoids double-counting through the use of order- and
duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses that compactly sum-
marize intermediate results during in-network aggregation.
We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to
check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that
the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis diusion cre-
ate implicit acknowledgments of packet delivery. We show
that this property can, in turn, enable the system to adapt
message routing to dynamic message loss conditions, even
in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate,
using extensive simulations, the signicant robustness, ac-
curacy, and energy-eciency improvements of synopsis dif-
fusion over previous approaches.

Abstract:
This paper presents a combination of a 3D laser sensor and a line-base SLAM algorithm which together produce 2D line maps of highly cluttered indoor environments. The key of the described method is the replacement of commonly used 2D laser range sensors by 3D perception. A straightforward algorithm extracts a virtual 2D scan that also contains partially occluded walls. These virtual scans are used as input for SLAM using line segments as features. The paper presents the used algorithms and experimental results that were made in a former industrial bakery. The focus lies on scenes that are known to be problematic for pure 2D systems. The results demonstrate that mapping indoor environments can be made robust with respect to both, poor odometry and clutter.

Abstract:
In this paper we present a new approach for natural feature extraction using a laser scanner for the purpose of localization in outdoor environments. In semi-structured outdoor environments, naturally predominant features such as trees and edges are considered. The proposed method applies a batch processing which carries out feature extraction after measurements from a full scan are received. The algorithm consists of data segmentation and parameter acquisition. A modified Gauss-Newton method is proposed for fitting circle parameters iteratively. The natural features extracted through this approach are more robust than those obtained by existing methods. In order to reduce the estimation error caused by the linearization in the extended Kalman filtering (EKF), a particle filter is applied to realize the prediction and validation by integrating data from both the laser range sensor and encoder in outdoor environments. The proposed feature extraction and localization algorithms are verified in a real world experiment.

Abstract:
A method is presented for the segmentation and description of 3-D objects in a range image. The image is segmented in two parallel ways: by region classification based on surface normal analysis and by edge detection using a relaxation process. The two results are combined by a small rule-based system to obtain a more reliable segmentation. Features of the 3D object at different levels are extracted and a surface attributes graph is constructed. This kind of view-independent description of 3D objects is effective and robust for object recognition and location. The objects considered are industrial parts composed of planes and quadric surfaces. The range image is provided by a laser scanner

Abstract:
This paper presents the algorithms that have been developed and integrated onto the HILARE 2 mobile robot for achieving robust navigation, in presence of control and sensing errors, in an a priori known office-like environment. The mobile robot is equipped with a belt of 32 sonars and a laser range finder. Sonar data are used for the wall-following, move to contact and parallel actions. The laser is used for edge detection and matching during a wall-following. A VME rack supporting 6 CPU boards of the Motorola 680x0 family is mounted on the robot running under the VxWorks real-time system

Abstract:
Range data provide an important source of 3-D shape information. This information can be used to extract jump boundaries which correspond to occluding boundaries of objects in a scene and "edges" which correspond to points lying between significantly different regions on the surface of objects. We are mainly interested in range data obtained from sensors such as lasers. The main problem with this type of range finders is the fact that the accuracy of the measurements depends on the power of the signal that reaches the receiver. This study describes how a range edge detection procedure can be designed that has low sensitivity to noise and imbeds all the knowledge available on the range measurement accuracy.

Laser Based Pose Tracking

The trend in localization is towards using more and
more detailed models of the world. Our aim has been
to answer the question "How simple a model can be
used to provide and maintain pose information in an
in-door setting?". In this paper a Kalman filter based
method for continuous position updating using a laser
scanner is presented. By updating the position at a
high frequency the matching problem becomes tractable
and outliers can effectively be filtered out by means of
validation gates. Presented experimental results show
that the method performs very well in an in-door environment.

Abstract:
Some types of laser range scanner can measure range and color data simultaneously, and are often used to acquire 3D structure of outdoor scenery. However, unfortunately a laser range scanner cannot give us perfect range information about the target objects such as buildings, and various factors incur critical defects of range data. We present a defect detection scheme based on region segmentation using observed range-and-color data, and apply a nonlinear time-evolution method to the repair of defect regions of range data. As to the defect detection, performing range-and-color segmentation, we divide observed data into several regions corresponding to buildings, the sky, the ground, etc. Using the segmentation results, we determine defect regions as occlusion regions of buildings. Given defect regions, their range data will be repaired from the observed data in their neighborhoods. For that purpose, we adapt the time-evolution algorithm, originally developed for the repair of an intensity image, for the repair of range data.

Abstract:
This paper describes edge detection as a composition of four steps: conditioning, feature extraction, blending, and scaling. We examine the role of geometry in determining good features for edge detection and in setting parameters for functions to blend the features. We find that: (1) statistical features such as the range and standard deviation of window intensities can be as effective as more traditional features such as estimates of digital gradients; (2) blending functions that are roughly concave near the origin of feature space ran provide visually better edge images than traditional choices such as the city-block and Euclidean norms; (3) geometric considerations ran be used to specify the parameters of generalized logistic functions and Takagi-Sugeno input-output systems that yield a rich variety of edge images; and (4) understanding the geometry of the feature extraction and blending functions is the key to using models based on computational learning algorithms such as neural networks and fuzzy systems for edge detection. Edge images derived from a digitized mammogram are given to illustrate various facets of our approach

Abstract:
The present manuscript aims at solving four problems of edge detection: the simultaneous detection of all step edges from a fine to a coarse scale; the detection of thin bars with a width of very few pixels; the detection of trihedral junctions; the development of an algorithm with image-independent parameters. The proposed solution of these problems combines an extensive spatial filtering with classical methods of computer vision and newly developed algorithms. Step edges are computed by extracting local maxima from the energy summed over a large bank of directional odd filters with a different scale. Thin roof edges are computed by considering maxima of the energy summed over narrow odd and even filters along the direction providing maximal response. Junctions are precisely detected and recovered using the output of directional filters. The proposed algorithm has a threshold for the minimum contrast of detected edges: for the large number of tested images this threshold was fixed equal to three times the standard deviation of the noise present in usual acquisition system (estimated to be between 1 and 1.3 gray levels out of 256), therefore, the proposed scheme is in fact parameter free. This scheme for edge detection performs better than the classical Canny edge detector in two quantitative comparisons: the recovery of the original image from the edge map and the structure from motion task. As the Canny detector in previous comparisons was shown to be the best or among the best detectors, the proposed scheme represents a significant improvement over previous approaches.

Abstract:
Automatic image segmentation and object extraction play an important role in supporting content-based image coding, indexing, and retrieval. However, the low-level visual homogeneity critical (like color, texture, intensity, and so on) for segmentation do not lead to semantic objects directly because a semantic object can contain totally different gray levels, color, or texture. We propose an automatic model-based semantic object extraction algorithm by integrating object seeds with their region constraint graphs (perceptual models). Images are first partitioned into a set of homogeneous regions with accurate boundaries by integrating the results obtained by similarity-based region growing and edge detection procedures. We propose a 1-D fast entropic thresholding technique for determining the thresholds used in region growing and edge detection automatically. The object seeds, which are the intuitive and representative parts of semantic objects, are then distinguished from these homogeneous image regions. A seeded region aggregation procedure is used for merging the adjacent regions of a detected object seed to give a semantic object according to the perceptual model of the object. We focus on semantic human object generation by taking faces as object seeds and using a ratio-based perceptual model

mynote: really has segmented the image. The edge detection itself is not the contribution.

A methodology for evaluating range image segmentation algorithms is proposed. This methodology involves (1) a common set of 40 laser range finder images and 40 structured light scanner images that have manually specified ground truth and (2) a set of defined performance metrics for instances of correctly segmented, missed, and noise regions, over- and under-segmentation, and accuracy of the recovered geometry. A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth. Four research groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches

ABSTRACT
In this correspondence, we present a new computationally efficient three-dimensional (3-D) object segmentation technique. The technique is based on the detection of edges in the image. The edges can be classified as belonging to one of the three categories: fold edges, semistep edges (defined here), and secondary edges. The 3-D image is sliced to create equidepth contours (EDCs). Three types of critical points are extracted from the EDCs. A subset of the edge pixels is extracted first using these critical points. The edges are grown from these pixels through the application of some masks proposed in this correspondence. The constraints of the masks can be adjusted depending on the noise present in the image. The total computational effort is small since the masks are applied only over a small neighborhood of critical points (edge regions). Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented in parallel, as edge growing from different regions can be carried out independently of each other.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel and highly robust estimator, called MDPE1 (Maximum Density Power Estimator). This estimator applies nonparametric density estimation and density gradient estimation techniques in parametric estimation (¡°model fitting¡±). MDPE optimizes an objective function that measures more than just the size of the residuals. Both the density distribution of data points in residual space and the size of the residual corresponding to the local maximum of the density distribution, are considered as important characteristics in our objective function. MDPE can tolerate more than 85% outliers. Compared with several other recently proposed similar estimators, MDPE has a higher robustness to outliers and less error variance.
We also present a new range image segmentation algorithm, based on a modified version of the MDPE (Quick-MDPE), and its performance is compared to several other segmentation methods. Segmentation requires more than a simple minded application of an estimator, no matter how good that estimator is: our segmentation algorithm overcomes several difficulties faced with applying a statistical estimator to this task.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce improved rules for Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision that overcome several problems with the original schemes (lack of smoothness at extraordinary boundary vertices, folds near concave corners). In addition, our approach to rule modification allows generation of surfaces with prescribed normals, both on the boundary and in the interior, which considerably improves control of the shape of surfaces. 1 Introduction Subdivision surfaces have rapidly gained popularity...

Abstract:
Automation of welding process in shipyard is ultimately necessary, since welding site is spatially enclosed by floors and girders, and therefore welding operators are exposed to hostile working conditions. To solve this problem, recently a robotic welding system for closed block assembly has been developed. For complete autonomy, this system needs a sensor system for the weld seam tracking and the recognition of the working environments. In this paper, a three-dimensional laser vision system is developed based on the optical triangulation technology in order to provide robots with work environmental map. This sensor system composed of three laser stripes and two visions is used to detect the welding positions and to recognize the 3D shape of the welding environments. The algorithm architecture for the welding environment recognition is divided into two parts. The first is the conventional 3D scanning module, and the second the plane generation module utilizing a Hough transform. The design of the sensor system and the algorithm for sensing the structured environment are described and discussed in detail

Abstract:
Presents a probabilistic algorithm for simultaneously estimating the pose of a mobile robot and the positions of nearby people in a previously mapped environment. This approach, called the conditional particle filter, tracks a large distribution of person locations conditioned upon a smaller distribution of robot poses over time. This method is robust to sensor noise, occlusion, and uncertainty in robot localization. In fact, conditional particle filters can accurately track people in situations with global uncertainty over robot pose. The number of samples required by this filter scales linearly with the number of people being tracked, making the algorithm feasible to implement in real-time in environments with large numbers of people. Experimental results illustrate the accuracy of tracking and model selection, as well as the performance of an active following behavior based on this algorithm.

Robust Stabilization of Bilinear Systems with Parametric Uncertainty
by Non-Linear State Feedback
Khadija Rhoulami, Abdelhak Bouaziz

Keyswords: Non linear control systems, Robust control,
Bilinear systems, and Gronwall-Bellman lemma.
Abstract
We present a result on the robust stabilization of class of
non-linear systems with parametric uncertainty via linear
and non-linear state feedback. The controller proposed is
based upon a generalization of Gronwall¡¯s lemma
developed by N. El Alami [1]. The proposed feedback
control law is a smooth function of the state, and requires
information of bounding functions on the size of
uncertainties. The main results of this paper are sufficient
conditions for the existence of the robust state feedback
controller stabilizing the bilinear systems

Linearized Error Propagation in Odometry
Alonzo Kelly Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, USA
The related fields of mobile robotics and ground vehicle localization lack a linearized theory of odometry error propagation. By contrast, the equivalent Schuler dynamics which apply to inertial guidance have been known and exploited for decades. In this paper, the general solution of linearized propagation dynamics of both systematic and random errors for vehicle odometry is developed and validated. The associated integral transforms are applied to the task of eliciting the major dynamic behaviors of errors for several forms of odometry. Interesting behaviors include path independence, response to symmetric inputs, zeros, extrema, monotonicity and conservation. Applications to systems theory, systems design, and calibration are illustrated.

By the extrapolation of movement increments detected by differential encoders, the position of a mobile robot can be easily computed. However, the encoders suffer from various systematic errors resulting in an increasing error of the obtained robot position. This problem is also known from the scope of inertial navigation, but the transfer of the respective concepts of maintaining merely errors to mobile robot localization has, with few exceptions, been neglected so far. In this paper, the position error is related to the encoder errors in an augmented state-space system. As done in inertial guidance, the position error is estimated by an error-state Kalman filter making use of general complementary sensor information as, for example, absolute position measurements or redundantly detected movement increments. Specifically, the usage of a rate gyroscope as a complementary sensor is examined. This case is somehow special, as it implies a correlation of the overall error model and the observation, demanding a modification of the Kalman filter equations. The derived filter is embedded in the localization scheme of the robot in partly closed-loop mode allowing a mutual online-correction of the encoder readings and the gyroscope output. As demonstrated by exemplary trajectories, the proposed localization scheme can substantially improve the position estimation. Furthermore, it can easily be modified to accept, for example, absolute position measurements as a complement to its own position estimation.

Survey of Robotic Applications for Odor-Sensing Technology
This paper presents a review of the current status of chemical sensing
as a sensory modality for mobile robots. Of the numerous techniques
that are available for detecting chemicals, only a few have so far
proved suitable for robotics applications. These are described and
evaluated. To infer useful information from readings of chemical
concentration, attention must be paid to the control and/or measurement
of airflow close to the sensor. Experiments that incorporate
aspects of airflow control and/or measurement are outlined. The information
about chemical concentration is then used to control the
motion of a robot. There follows a description of the reactive, often
biologically inspired, control algorithms that have been used for this
purpose. In conclusion, the present state of development of robotic
chemical sensing is assessed.

This paper describes a mobile robot equipped with a sonar sensor array in a guided, feature-based map-building task in an indoor environment. The landmarks common to indoor environments areplanes, corners, and edges, and these are located and classified with the sonar sensor array The map-building process makes use of accurate odometry information that is derivedfiom apair ofknife-edged unloaded encoder wheels. Discrete sonar observations are incrementally merged into partial planes to produce a realistic representation of the environment that is amenable to sonar localization. Collinearity constraints among featurs ar exploited to enhance both the map-featwe estimation and robot localization. The map update employs an iterated extended Kalmanfilter in the first implementation and subsequently a comparison is made with the Julier-Uhlmann-Durrant-Whyte Kalman filter which improves the accuracy of covariance propagation when nonlinear equations are involved. The map accounts for correlation among features and robot positions. Partial planes am also used to eliminate phantom targets caused by specular reflection of the sonar. Unclassifiable sonar targets are integrated into the map for the purpose of obstacle avoidance. The paper presents simulated and experimental data.

Abstract. We present an approach to human-robot interaction through gesture-free spoken dialogue. Our approach
is based on passive knowledge rarefication through goal disambiguation, a technique that allows a human operator
to collaborate with a mobile robot on various tasks through spoken dialogue without making bodily gestures. A key
assumption underlying our approach is that the operator and the robot share a common set of goals. Another key idea
is that language, vision, and action share common memory structures.We discuss how our approach achieves four
types of human-robot interaction: command, goal disambiguation, introspection, and instruction-based learning.
We describe the system we developed to implement our approach and present experimental results.

Abstract:
Algorithms for constructing velocity approximations from discrete position versus time data are investigated. The study is limited to algorithms suitable to provide velocity information in discrete-time feedback control systems such as microprocessor-based systems with a discrete position encoder. Velocity estimators based on lines per period, reciprocal-time, Taylor series expansion, backward difference expansions, and least-square curve fits are presented. Based on computer simulations, comparisons of relative accuracies of the different algorithms are made. The least-squares velocity estimators filtered the effect of imperfect measurements best, whereas the Taylor series expansions and backward difference equation estimators respond better to velocity transients

Abstract:
Because each of the position transducers commonly used in industry, i.e., encoders and resolvers, do not inherently measure an instantaneous velocity, some signal processing technique is generally required to improve the accuracy of velocity estimation at each sampling instant. This estimated signal is then used as the velocity feedback signal for the velocity loop control. The differential position technique commonly used in industry for velocity estimation suffers from a large quantization error and, therefore, limits the servo control loop bandwidth. This paper presents both the theoretical analysis and experimental verification of a scheme that uses a closed-loop observer for velocity estimation. The results have shown that the quantization error in the velocity feedback signal can be reduced dramatically when a closed-loop observer is used for velocity estimation. The results also shown that, at low speed, the velocity estimation could be improved with a simple compensation scheme

Abstract:
A sensorless velocity controller for the permanent-magnet synchronous motor is designed using discrete-time reduced order models. A nonlinear observer estimates the rotor position and velocity from stator current measurements, thus eliminating the need for shaft-mounted sensors. The observer is based on least-squares optimization, and exploits a piecewise-bilinear representation of the back-EMF (speed-voltage) function. By smoothly switching from an observer-based closed-loop control to an open-loop control at low velocity, observer ill-conditioning is avoided and reliable operation is achieved under all operating conditions. The new scheme delivers performance comparable to sensor-based closed-loop control, yet requires only a moderate amount of online computation. Experimental results provide evidence of the viability and performance of the new scheme

Abstract:
The paper is devoted to the problem of rejecting oscillatory position-dependent disturbances with unknown frequency and unknown amplitude. The considered disturbances are assumed to be produced by eccentricity in mechanical systems and drives. Most of the previous works on eccentricity cancellation assume a time-depending oscillation, we instead assume that the oscillatory disturbance is position-dependent. This leads us to formulate and to globally solve the adaptive cancellation problem using a velocity-dependent internal model of the eccentricity. The proposed control design results in an asymptotically globally stable adaptive eccentricity compensator (AEC). An apparatus with rolling eccentricity has been built to test the controller. The paper presents a series of experimental results showing the improvements of this controller. Also a comparative study with a simple proportional integral (PI) regulator is presented

Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the active compensation of the roll-eccentricity-induced periodic disturbances in the strip exit thickness of hot and cold rolling mills. The roll eccentricity may be caused by different reasons, e.g., inexact roll grinding or nonuniform thermal expansion of the rolls. The increasing demands on the thickness tolerances require new methods for the active compensation of the contribution of the roll eccentricity to the final thickness deviation. The presented method is based on the factorization approach over the set of stable transfer functions in combination with an adaptive least-mean-squares algorithm derived from the projection theorem. Here, the authors take advantage of the fact that the eccentricity-caused disturbance is periodic with a frequency proportional to the measured angular velocity of the rolls. Furthermore, it turns out that the presented concept fits the conventional control circuit of automatic gauge control in an optimal way. Simulation results for a cold rolling mill and measurement results for a hot strip mill demonstrate the feasibility and the excellent performance of the design

2  Selection criteria of induction machines for speed-sensorless drive applications
Nandi, S.; Ahmed, S.; Toliyat, H.A.; Bharadwaj, R.M.;
Industry Applications, IEEE Transactions on , Volume: 39 , Issue: 3 , May-June 2003
Pages:704 - 712
Abstract:
Induction motors, both three and single phase, are used extensively for adjustable-speed drives' applications. These machines are structurally very robust and are a primary source of motive power and speed control where DC machines cannot be used. For closed-loop control of these machines, sensorless speed estimation is usually preferred. Among the current estimation techniques available for speed-sensorless induction motor drives, speed measurement based on rotor-slot-related harmonic detection in machine line current happens to be a prominent one. While these harmonics can be strong in certain kinds of machines, some other machines may exhibit very weak rotor slot harmonics that can be obscured by noise. Skewing, slot shapes and types, structural unbalances, etc., also have a prominent effect on the detectability of these harmonics. This paper attempts to investigate this problem based on the interaction of pole pairs, number of rotor bars, and stator winding. Although the analysis and experimental results have been mainly provided for three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors, single-phase and slip-ring induction motors have also been addressed. Further, it has been shown that eccentricity-related fault detection could also be easily accommodated with this kind of speed detection technique at no or negligible extra cost when certain motors are selected.

The general aim of visual servoing is to control the motion of a robot so that visual features acquired by a camera become superimposed with a desired visual pattern. Visual servoing based on geometrical features such as image point coordinates is now well established. Nevertheless, this approach has the drawback that it usually needs visual marks on the observed object to retrieve geometric features. The idea developed in this paper is to use motion in the image as the input of the control scheme since it can be estimated without any a priori knowledge of the observed scene. Thus, more realistic scenes or objects can be considered. Two different methods are presented. In the first method, geometric features are retrieved by integration of motion, which allows the use of classical control laws. This method is applied toa6degree-of-freedom positioning task. The authors show that, in such a case, an affine model of 2-D motion is insufficient to ensure convergence and that a quadratic model is needed. In the second method, the principle is to try to obtain a desired 2-D motion field in the image sequence. In usual image-based visual servoing, variations of visual features are linearly linked to the camera velocity. In this case, the corresponding relation is more complex, and the authors describe how it is possible to use this relation. This approach is illustrated with two tasks: positioning a camera parallel to a plane and following trajectory.

(i) nonlinear model-based control of complex nonlinear and distributed processes, and (ii) the application of systems engineering tools to problems in biology. The former topic is addressed with advanced simulation, optimization, and model reduction methodologies, and the problems of interest span the chemical, pulp & paper, and pharmaceutical sectors. Of particular interest are the control of distributions in particule systems. In the area of systems biology, we bring traditional systems engineering tools (e.g., model identification, parametric sensitivity, and closed-loop analysis) to analyze complex, hierarchical biological systems. The guiding principle is that systems-level behavior can only be understood by considering systematic interactions across multiple time and spatial dimensions.
